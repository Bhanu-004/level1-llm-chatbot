# LLM Smart Assistant (Level 1)

This is a visually appealing, voice-enabled AI chatbot built using Google's Gemini API. It supports both **text and voice input**, provides **spoken responses**, and saves the entire conversation in a `.txt` log file â€” all in a single Python file with a dark-themed GUI.
